## Project Pipeline

* [Hosted API _on Heroku_](https://teamed.herokuapp.com/)
* [API Docs](https://teamed.herokuapp.com/docs)


## Technologies Used

* NodeJS/ExpressJS
* PostgreSQL
* Express-Validator (_for server-side validation_)
* Mocha & Supertest (_for automated testing_)
* Swagger (_for API documentation using openapi 3.0.0 spec_)


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### Installing/Running locally

- Clone or fork repoü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

  ```bash
    - git clone https://github.com/meetKazuki/Teamwork.git
    - cd Teamwork
    - npm install
  ```

- Create a PostgreSQL database by running the command below in `psql`

  ```bash
    createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres <database-for-dev>
  ```

- Create/configure `.env` environment with your credentials. A sample `.env.example` file has been provided to get you started. Make a duplicate of `.env.example` and rename to `.env`, then configure your credentials (ensure to provide the correct details).

- Run `npm run dev` to start the server and watch for changes

### Testing

Test specs are implemented using [_mocha_](https://mochajs.org) & [_chai_](https://chiajs.com).

- To test or consume the API locally, you can make use of [_Postman_](https://www.getpostman.com) to simulate a front-end client.

- You can also run an automated test. Just ensure to follow the step below

  ```bash
   createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres <database-for-test>
  ```

- Fire up the tests by running `npm test`. `npm test` performs a single full test suite run, including code coverage reporting.


## HTTP Requests

All API requests are made by sending a secure HTTPS request using one of the following methods, depending on the action being taken:

- `POST` Create a resource
- `GET` Get a resource or list of resources
- `PATCH` Update a resource
- `DELETE` Delete a resource

For `POST` and `PATCH` requests, the body of your request may include a JSON payload.

### HTTP Response Codes

Each response will be returned with one of the following HTTP status codes:

- `200` `OK` The request was successful
- `400` `Bad Request` There was a problem with the request (security, malformed)
- `401` `Unauthorized` The supplied API credentials are invalid
- `403` `Forbidden` The credentials provided do not have permissions to access the requested resource
- `404` `Not Found` An attempt was made to access a resource that does not exist in the API
- `412` `Authorization Header not set` An attempt was made to access a protected route without providing a token
- `500` `Server Error` An error on the server occurred
